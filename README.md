# JustAnotherPersonalLibrary

A centeralized system to index and search a set of notes(written in markdown or in text format).
This application when given a set of markdown files will index them so that we can peform complex searches to get the file best fitting the search query.

## What we are trying to achieve

- Perform searches in a vast volume of files to find the file best fitting the search
- View markdown and text files as a note reading application
- Add meta-data to files like tags to categorise the files
- View and maintain different notes in a centralized location
