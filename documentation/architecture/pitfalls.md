# Pitfalls / Issues

## Handling asynchronous calls with engine

- loading big documents in chunks
- subscription or event based??
- showing loading spinner 

## Python & JS Interaction

- making python calls from javascript (python js wrapper??)
- spawning threads from js
- js event from python

## Finding a keyword in one document

- fetching single document index from engine
- implementing string pattern matching algo in JS (chose one)

## Caching in UI??

- Caching document data & indexes (Find a caching JS library)
- Caching search results 


## UI document Parser
- Which will parse the raw data into HTML tag. To show .md files properly.

## Design of the Interface
